# Hello World 👋

Thank you for contributing to this project 🙏

To keep the code clean 🧹 and organized 🗒️, we'd like you to follow some simple rules 📏 (or your work will not be taken in consideration 😱):

---
## ISSUES
When you create an issue, make sure it :
- Says where the issue is, or come from
- Be clear about how to reproduce the issue (with code if possible)

### Furthermore please follow this convention for naming your issues:
```
<type>: your issue message
```
**`<type>`** can be one of the following :
- **cicd**: Changes to the CI/CD
- **docs**: Changes to the documentation
- **feat**: Creation of a new feature
- **fix**: Fix a bug
- **perf**: Changes that only improve performance
- **refactor**: A code change that do not add features or fix a bug 
- **style**: Changes that does not affect the code (whit-space, formatting, etc...)
- **test**: Creating a test

---
## COMMITS
Your commit messages must follow [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
with the same **`<type>`** than in the issues naming convention above 

---
## BRANCH
Your branch name should always refer to the issue it aims to fix.

Always base your branch on the master branch.

---
## MERGE REQUEST
Your merge request should explains clearly what it does.

It should also briefly explain what it changes in the code.

The name of the merge request must follow the same rule as the commit convention (because merge will be turned into commit in master)
